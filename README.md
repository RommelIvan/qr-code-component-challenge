## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Because using div tags is messy, I had to learn how to utilize Semantic HTML5 Markup.

```html
<article>
  This is Good
</article>
```

I also learnt how to organize the footer and QR Code Card using flexbox, as well as how to center the QR Code Card.

```css
/* QR Code Card and Footer */
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction: column;
}

/* Inside the QR Code Card, Image and Texts */
article {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

### Continued development

This design might be great for my future projects, like a QR Code generator.
